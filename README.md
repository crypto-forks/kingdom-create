`create-buildspace-dao` generates DAO starter boilerplate made by the [buildspace](https://github.com/buildspace) community. 


## Getting Started

To create a project, run:
```
npx create-buildspace-dao my-dao

Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` and provide values for all required fields.

Start the application in the development mode:
```
cd my-dao && npm run start
```
